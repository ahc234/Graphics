Additional comments
Our additional animation is titled "HorseAnimation.txt".  The animation consists of a horse running.  To make our animation have a running effect, we modified the animation code such that all animation repeat at their final frame.  This makes our animation look nice and doesn't take away from the functionality of the other animations.
